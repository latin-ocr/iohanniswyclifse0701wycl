INTRODUCTJON. XXVII

[n this Codex, containing the second part of the Sermones and the
Sermones mixti, some Czechian glosses are to be found, as for example
on folio 138³, in the margin: Mil-51 Husko i. e. dear goose. (Huska is
the Latinised form of Hus' name7 and was in very common use with
his contemporarieS.)¹ In the same way, on folio 115b occurs the
gloss: Dobra Hnsko, i. e. good goose. The scribe was therefore
of opinion that Hus was the author of all these sermonS, and if
occasionally in any sermon England Was referred to, this either did
not disturb him, or he unscrupulously altered the regnum ‘Anglie' into
regnum ‘Boemie' and turned the English church into a church of
Prague‚ as may be seen from the following comparison:

Cod. Cambr. Β. 16, 2:

Et utinam regnum Anglie attenderet
et servaret istam sentenciam. Tunc enim
non foret depauperatum regnum et (sic)
per ambos ypocritas sicut modo. Cum
enim bona ecclesie sunt bona pauperum,
restat quod bona ecclesie Anglicane nostri
regni sint bona pauperum . . .

Cod. Pal. Vindob. 3928:

Et utinam regnum Bohemie attenderet
et servaret istam sentenciam. Tunc non
foret depauperatum regnum per ambos
ypocritas sicut modo. Cum enim bona
ecclesie sint bona pauperum, restat quod
bona ecclesie Pragensis sint regni nostri
bona pauperum . . . .

3. The date os composition ot the sermons.

Of Wyclif‘s sermons, a considerable number have come down to
us which we may presume to belong to a comparatively early period.
&Vc find even in early MSS. a whole group of sermons divided off
from the others7 and the observation appended, that Wyclif here
appears in a wholly different light and that these sermons cont-ain
nothing contrary to catholic doctrine. 2 Of another group, it is said
that they date from a time when Wyclif still occupied the pulpit‚ 3

Infelix auca, narrans verissima pauca. . . . Cf. Stephani Dolanensis Dial. int. aucam
et passerem. Hoc si tu magister Huska tuis senioribus obaudisscs . . . .

² Cod. Pal. Vind. sol. 193: Constat omnibus quod iste Wycliff quadraginta sermones
istos scribens fuit alius a se ipso hic quarn alibi, quia demptis paucissimis pene in
omnibus his scriptis sequitur ecclesiam in fide et ritibus et modo loquendi katholico.
