INTRODUCTION. XXXVII

On the first leaf is the (printed) statement that Thomas Nevile,
Dean of Canterbury and Master of Trinity College presented the
Codex to the Library.

b) The Codex pal. vindobonensis 3934 (Β).

This Codex (size 31 by 210111') contains on 151 paper leaves in folio:
1. 1²¹ to 132b: The first part of Wyclif’s Sermones de tempore.
2 134a to 147b: Johannis Lemovicensis Moralis exposicio somni

a,

Pharaonis.
3. 148³: loramentum Alsonis episcopi Olomucensis factum coram

Conrado archiepiscopo Pragensi in confirmacione eius.

4. 148b to 151³: Notabilia et excerpta e iure canonico, Patrum

loca de ceremoniis, purgatorio, aqua lustrali etc .....

Some passages on page 149 are remarkable. They contain short
extracts from Wyclifs De Ecclesia, etc. mostly on his theory of the
Church. On both the inner sides of the cover, leaves covered with
writing are pasted. The first leaf contains the Incipit of the sermons
and the other contents of the Codex. On the second leaf, written
backwards‚ are the words ‘Wykleff super evangelia de tempore'.

The codex has been written with some care, and in many places
corrections have been very neatly inserted.

The scribe was a Bohemian as appears from a side-note. Some
notes written with black ink proceed from two later hands.

These scribes sometimes controvert the contents of the text: and
often the warning words occur: Cave, cave, bene caveaS, sis cautus
hic (cf. on page 92, 1. 20, note; page 165, 1. 8, note). Cave pessimas
hereses (cf. page 165, 1. 26, note): reccius fecisses, si psalterium
repeciisses, hereseos pestes tam pravas non seminasses (page 164,
l. 25, note). Cave ista usque ad finem (page 306, l. 11, note). Mira res
quod in uno et eodem sermone loquitur sibi contrarie de confessione.
Non enirn principium correspondet fini, sed repugnat, principium
pulcrum, finis perversus.

In the 60th sermon (page 401, 1. 17, note) it runs: Cave hic,
quia destruit pene totum clerum preter sacerdocium et levitas.

The marginal notes are not equally distributed throughout the
sermonS. In some passages they are altogether missing, whilst in
others they are very common.
