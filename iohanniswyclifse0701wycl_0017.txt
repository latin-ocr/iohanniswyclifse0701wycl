INTRODUCTION. XI

The excuse that the hearers are often incapable of comprehending
the Lord's word cannot be accepted, for the incapacity of the hearers
is caused by the negligence of the priestS.¹

c) How to preach to the people.

On the manner in which Wyclif would have the people taught,
Lechler has written so admirably, that it will only be necessary here
to refer to what he has said.2 In a great number of passages Wyclif
expresses the desire that the preacher should adapt the subject> that
he treats to the comprehension of his hearers. 3 He should proclaim
evangelical truth in a “suitable manner''. The sermon should be
short but complete, and in any case simple.⁴ All sermons must be
delivered in a right spirit. If the soul does not harmonize with the
words, how can the words have power? If love is wanting in thee,
thou art sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. ⁵ To these requirements
Wyclif further adds, that the sermon should be pointed, without being
bitter. The preacher might proceed in the same manner as Christ
did against the pharisee-s. Above all, the preacher's word should spring
from the depths of his heart, for thus the Saviour spoke.

It cannot be denied that Wyclif complies in his own sermons
with the rather severe demands which he makes upon preachers.

In spite of much scholastic byplay, the style of most of his
sermons is plain and simple, the language vivid, and the comparisons‚
where such occur, taken from life.

The tone of fierce upbraiding, in which the monks especially
are addressed, is not unfrequently exchanged for one of subtile irony.

In several sermons Wyclif gives directions how to preach the
word of God to the people, for instance, in the sermon Circm‘hat
