possible of Christ’s manner of life. ¹ ssut he who would pre-ach rightly,
must be well acquainted with the Gospel, for God's word only has
life-giving power, and by it alone are members of the Church created.
By the preaching of the Apostles the Church grew, and since preaching
has been neglected the Church has constantly declined. ² In preaching
one must follow the example of Christ, who has written his law, not
on the, skins of dead animans, buttin the hearts of men.3

Wyclif says in the 57Ῐῂ Sermon of the second part: After having
explained to whom the apostles should preach, it still remains to be
set forth what should be preached, and in what manner.4

Christ has said: Go out and proclaim that the kingdom of heaven
is at hand. One must preach of the kingdom of heaven, of the
kingdom of Christ, of the Lord's Advent, of the Church militant,
the Church triumphant, and of the universal or catholic Church, of
the old and the new law, but above all of Christ and His incarnation,
and of the preparation of man for eternal blessedness. As the time
is already at hand in which Christ prepares man for obtaining this
blessedness, the preacher must exhort his hearers “to set to work’' in
order to obtain it. 5 This it is which must be preached to the people‚
not tragedies or comedies or fictions or apocryphal sentenceS, as is
the habit of preachers in these days.

ln order to convince even the foolish of the truth of the Gospel,
Christ commanded the Apostles: Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
the lepers, and cast out demons. According to this, modern preachers
also must act.

¹ De officio past„ pag. 35: Cum ergo evangelium maxime docet conversacionem
Christi penalem, hii timent Antichristi discipuli quod eorum retrocessio vel obviacio
legi Domini cognoscatur. Et hec racio quare nolunt evangelium predicari ex integro,
sed curte ut faciunt fratres, ne Christi conversacio cognoscatur. 2 Serm. ΙΙ, 22.
3 ibid. 4 Dato quibus apostoli predicarent, docet Christus in hoc evangelio con-
sequenter quid et qualiter predicarent. Dicunt enim quidam quod regnum celorum
sex modis accipitur . . . . Sed aliis videtur quod regnum celorum solum tripliciter
accipitur in scriptura . In proposito autern videtur accipi pro Christo quoad
suam humanitatem vel pro disposicione qua viantes preparat ad regnandum . .
5 Ideo curn iam instat tempus in quo tam efficaciter disponit ad beatitudinem ad-
quirendam debet predicator hortari suos, ut manum apponant ad opera . . . . Istud
ergo est predicandum populo et non tragedie vel come-die aut fabule vel sentencie
apocriphe que sunt hodie populo predicate.
