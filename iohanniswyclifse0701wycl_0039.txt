INTRODUCTION. XXXIII

Perhaps Wyclif's strongest language against the mendicant friars
is to be found in the 48⁸¹ sermon of the Second Part, where they are
stigmatised as gluttons‚ whose belly is the special kitchen of the
devil. To enable themselves to indulge in gluttony, they build kitchens
in the abbeys, which are far more splendid than those of kings.¹ It
is noticeable also how Wyclif speaks here of the pope: “Beside these
Pharisees, the endowed as well as the mendicant orclem, unlawfully
introduced into the Church, there is a blasphemous king at their head
whom some call Antichrist. For he with his followers claims to lead
the Church in the absence of Christ, altogether contrary to God’s
law.”2

No longer conditionally‚ as in the former writings of Wyclif,
but unconditionally‚ the Pope is here called Antichrist. And this the
scribes have indicated in the MSS. by the words “Papa summus
Antichristus”.

It is evident from what has been said, that all these sermons must
be dated within the years 1382—1384: and we may gather too, that
the first Part of the sermons was not composed much earlier.

This Part contains only Sunday sermons (sermones dominicales).
There are enumerated 25 Sermons after Trinity‚ therefore 26 after
Whitsuntide, which would correspond to the Sundays in the year 1382,
if one could believe that Wyclif himself delivered the sermonS, and
not, as is more probable‚ only composed them for the use of the
travelling priestS.

That this Part also of the sermons belongs to the time of the
Schism‚ and not to a very early stage of it, is evident by the allusion
in the 19⁸¹ Sermon to the events of the year 1380: “Benedicta ergo

membris suis vendicat in absencia Christi regulare ecclesiam et ordinare illis ad
voluntatem officia, contraria ministerio quod Trinitas ordinavit. A still stronger
expression is: ac ministri diaboli quem quidam vocant Romanum pontificem.
