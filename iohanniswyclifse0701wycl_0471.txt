1. Though only one of the books promist for 1886, namely,
De Benedicta Incaruacione, edited by the Rev. Edwin Harris,
M.A.‚ was issued during that year, yet the other, vol. 1. of
Wyclif's Sermone-5², edited by Prof. J. Loserth, Ph.D.‚ is all
printed, and will be sent to Members as soon as the sheets
reach England, and can be bound. With it, will go out Mr.
Rudolf Beer’s edition of De Compose'cione Hominis, which is
ῗ180 311 printed, and which belongs 10 1110 Society's issue
or 1884.

The De Benedicta Lecamaz‘e'one is a work of WVyclif's middle
period (about 1365), purely scholastic in form, but very
characteristic, shewing that Wyclif was striving for a
theology deeper and more satisfying than the distinctions
and definitions of 1110 80110018 could supply. It shews too
that Wyelif was already moving towards 1118 final views
on the Eucharist, although he had not yet consciously broken
with the doctrine of Transubstantiation.

The De Composz'csone is one of Wyclif's early works, prob-
ably compiled by him for his scholastic lectures at Oxford.
The Sermons belong 10 1110 13101· period of the Reformer's
life. Though some of them may have been compiled earlier,
so early indeed as clam stetit in scholis, yet Prof. Loserth
shows that Wyclif must have revised them, doubtless for
the use of his ‘Poor Priests,' so late as 1110 years 1381-82.
