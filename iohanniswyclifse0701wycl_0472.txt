2 g 2. The Soez'ety’e Bookefor 1887 (md 1888.

His attacks on the mendicant friars, the Pope, and the abuses
of the Romish Church, are full of individuality and interest,
while his outlines of what a true Priest, a true Bishop, and
a true Church should be, show that his reforms were con-
structive as well as destructive.

2. For 1887, Prof. Loserth has in type part of the second
volume of Wyclif's Sermone, and hopes he may be able—
with Messrs. Fromme's and Mr. Matthew's help—to finish it
by Christmas. The Committee trust that Members will supply
them with money enough to enable a second volume to be issued
for the year, tho' perhaps not in it. This will no doubt be the
De Qffice'o Refflts· (Book VIII. of the Smnma Tlteoloffl‘ae)‚ edited
by Mr. W. A. Pollard, M.A.‚ the Editor of Wyelif’s De'aloque.
Dr. Reginald L. Poole hopes to get into type by the end
of 1887 the text of Wyolif's De Dominio Dice'no, and go to
Vienna to collate it with the MSS. early in 1888. He is
now working through the Treatise of which the first four
books will form the Appendix to his volume, the De Panpere'e
Sala-aforis of Richard Fitz-Ralph, Archbishop of Armagh.
This has never yet been printed, but as Dr. Poole has found
that it throws great light on the genesis of Wyclif's special
views of Dominion, he has had the most important part of
it copied for the Society from a Bodleian manuscript, and is
now collating it with a manuscript at Merton College. If Dr.
Poole can finish his volume in 1888, it and the Third Part of
Wyclif's Sermone will form the Society's issue for 1888.

Mr. F. D. Matthew has been obliged to give all the time
that he can spare the Society to writing the side-notes to
Prof. Loserth’s volume and Mr. Beer's. He has more than
once broken down in the attempt to work at his own editions
of Wyclif’s Miscellaneous Tracts and De illaudati-e, so that

the appearance of these must be deferd till more leisure and
stronger health come to him.

Dr. Buddensieg has done about a quarter of his edition os
the De Verz'z‘az‘e‚ but having accepted a call to the Head
Mastership of a Public High 8011001111 Dresden, his new duties
will compel him to set aside his Wyclif work for at least two or
three years. Besides the remaining volumes of Sermone, Prof.
Loserth has kindly undertaken to edit Wyelif’s De Euclea-
re'ete‘a tractatae mesor (Shirley, N ο. 18), and he has also copied,
and will edit, the Opus Evcmyeliemn, eice De Sermone Domini
in Monte (Shirley, N 0. 42). Dr. Herzberg-Friinkel, M. Patera,
