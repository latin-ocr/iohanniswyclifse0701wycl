XII INTRODUCTION.

Jeszts civitates et castella docens in synagogis. This Gospel‚ he says
gives manifold instructions to all disciples of Christ, be they priests
or deacons, how they are to preach the Gospel.¹ Sufficient matter for
sermons of every kind that the believer may require2 is to be found
in it, and it is evident from it that the preacher must have no other
airn than the salvation of his hearers. 3 He discusses the faults most
frequently to be found in the preachers of his time.

The first one is that they select for their sermons the “fat
places''‚⁴ where they can make the best profit, whilst Christ preached
everywhere, without regard to persons, in the open air, in the synagogue
and in houses. A further error is committed by the preacher being
restricted by episcopal authority to certain localities35 and therefore
in the third place the very people ⁶ are neglected in whom the sermon
might bear the most abundant fruits. It is the duty of the priest to
witness fearlessly and in every place to the truth, and even at the
risk of his life. He must not trouble himself about any new fashions⁷
in preaching which may arise3 his only care must be how to be
useful as far as possible to the people. He must care nothing for
popular favour. “Surely”, Wyclif laments⁷ “it is in these days as,
when the Saviour said: ‘The harvest is plentiful but of reapers, that
is of preacherS‚ there are few.’

Here, as well as in other sermons in which he criticises the
method of preaching in his times, he mixes up together considerations
of form and of matter.

¹ Hoc evangelium dat sormam multiplicem quomodo omnes Christi discipuli tam
sacerdotes quam dyaconi debent predicare instancius verbum Dei . . . . ² Et ista
magistri materia est sufficiens pro quibuscunque sermonibus populo predicandis . . ..
3 Tota sentencia predicandi stat in isto quod regnum celorum tam Christus quarn

ecclesia appropinquavit ad gradum beatitudinis . . .. quando videt membra Christi
magis proficere, debet predicator predicare populo quomodo assistente tanto adiutorio
pro beatitudine instancius laboraret.. . . ⁴ . . . . triplex error, primus quo (lisci-

puli Antiehristi captant sibi loca fertilicz lucro suo conveniencia, quando in locis
aliis plus prodessent . . . . ⁷¹ Secundus error est quo excluduntur evangelizantes
ex iurisdiccionis limitacione, ubi possent eciam invitis episcopis plus prodesse . . ..
r. Tercim error est quod inulti ignari putant se non debere predicare vel benefacere
populo qui a iurisdiccione sua excluditur. 7 Nec intenderet novitatem aut vocatam
subtilitatem sermocinandi introducere, sed pure cogitaret quomodo honorem Dei
et utilitatem populi apcius posset promovere . . . .
