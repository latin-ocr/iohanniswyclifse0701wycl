XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

ln some sermons there are blue, in others, red initial letters, in

others there are none. No relation can be proved to exist between
A and B.

c) Codex pal. Vindobonensis 4529 (C).

Small 4⁰ (2105 by 15cm) contains on 188 paper leaves:

1. Page 1²¹ to 165³: Johannis Wiclif Sermones in evangelia de

tempore cum prologo.

2. Page 169³ to 17ob: Tituli psalmorum.

3. Page 171³ to 188b: Gualtherus Burlaeus, de vita et moribus

philosophorum veterum.

On the inside cover, front and back, a parchment is added for
protection3 on this are remains of a theological treatise on the Last
Judgment. On the inside cover is written:

“Super Evangelia per circulum anni 10. Wyph b. Vite philoso-
phorum et moralitates.''

The writing is very careful. There are also several corrections,
very carefully made. There are no side-notes. Only the Sundays are
marked on which the sermons fall, and here and there a correction of
the text is marked in the margin.

The initials are in very small writing in the margin3 they were
evidently intended to be illuminated later.

Β and C form a separate group of MSS. as distinct from A:
they correspond in most readings3 but Β does not spring from C, as
in the latter the side-notes are missing, which the scribe of B doubtless
found in his ‘copy’ and did not compose himself.

On the other hand also C does not originate directly from B, as

it has many better readings than the latter. It is more probable that
both MSS. spring from a common source.

d) The Codex pal. vindobonensis 3928 (D).

A MS. on paper bound in green leather (size 31·05 by 22c1n)
contains 253 written and paged leaves: also 21 leaves not paged. Inside
the back cover, is the old signature M. 3866, then the words: In
nomine Domini. On the front of the inside cover we find, beside the new
signature, the following old ones: No. 31 ι, VII, J. 41, Dv. 1. p. 1488, 9,
