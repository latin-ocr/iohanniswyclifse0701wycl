Wyclif Sermones. The first leaf, and the beginning of the second
leaf, contain some excerpts from theological writings.

Page 1a to 128³: Ista pars vocatur secunda Sermonum. 128³:

Expliciunt Evangelia de Sanctis.

Page 128b to 186³: Sermones mixti XXIV.

Page 186 to 189³: Tractatus de sex iugis.

Page 189a to 190³: Enumeracio eorum que regi seculari in clerum

suum competunt moraliter peccantem.

Page 190b to 192b: vacat.

Page ¹93 to 253³: Sermones XXXVIII (partis IV).

Page 1 to 186 is written by one hand (early XV111Century); the
remainder is in another hand.

The writing is on the whole very careful. The scribe was a
Bohemian, as may be seen from the numerous side-notes in the Czech
language: page 22³: Kypiety zlym mnychom lharzon13 page 115b:
dobra Husc03 page 138³: mila Husc03 page 189³: Tak sem chtyel
etc ..... “

In the following text of the Sermones mixti, the numbers 2, 3
and 4 are inserted, which are in MSS. Β and C as the end of the
first part.

e) The Codex pal. Vindobonensis 3931 (Ε).

Contains on 203 paper leaves in folio (size 31 by 210111),

1. Page 1a to 1420: the second part of the Sermones.

2. Page 142C to 203³: the Sermones mixti.

On the inside of the back cover is a document pasted, containing
a license for a Prague door-keeper, dated Prague 1337, friars
January 13111.

From this we conclude that the MS. was written in Bohemia.
The Codices E and D belong to a separate group. In the readings,
D and E almost entirely coincide. The lacunae as well as the mistakes
of D are also to be found in E. D must be considered as ‘copy’ to
E; for E corrects some faults of D, and in E there are some
omissions where D gives the complete text.
