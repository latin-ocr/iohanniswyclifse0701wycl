XIV INTRODUCTION.

solve certain doubtsl which may arise respecting the passage under
consideration. To this topic the second part of his sermon is mostly
dedicated. As a rule, the second part is prefaced by the words: From
this Gospel 'the following doubts arise: [(Ex isto evangelio dubitari
potest (page 34, 5), Ex isto evangelio dubitatur (page 12, 26, 31, 38,
45, 60, 69, 75, 83 . . . .), Circa hoc evangelium dubitatur (page 281),
Sed dubitatur communiter. Ex isto evangelio notari potest.. . .)]
By these and similar words he introduces that part of the sermon
in which, in emphatic and often very violent language, he expresses
his ideas on the Church and on Church-government.

Here, as Lechler has observed, matters are very often treated
which have no immediate connexion with the contents of Scripture.
Wyclif speaks mostly about Church government, which as it existed
in his days was certainly not for the edification of believers. He
lays stress on the contrast between this and the Church-government
in the first centuries up to the so-called “imperialising’⁷ of the Church
by Constantine3 he discusses the claims of the hierarchy to worldly
property, and generally proceeds to speak of the great mischief which
the orders of mendicant friars have done, and still do, to the Church.
The later the date of the sermon, the stronger is its language3 the
most severe sermons of all are those composed during the last four
years of his life; and of these, the so-called Sermones mixti are
distinguished by a special vehemence. But these forty sermons lead
us to the question of Wyclif's school-sermons in general.

d) Wyclif’s school-sermons. The travelling preachers.

Of Wyclif's Latin sermons we may presume that they were delivered
or composed for a public which had had a scholastic education.

It is evident from the themes themselves, and from the manner in
which they are dealt with, that he had an educated audience before him.
Not a few of them, amongst these, for example, the first of the following
sermons, treat of difficult philosophical and theological problems3 their
language too is somewhat cumbrous, involved, and often obscure.

intendo breviter sensum misticum explanare et secundo more Augustini salutabo
dubia que ex evangelio possent capi.
