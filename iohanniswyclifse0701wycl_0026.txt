XX INTRODUCTION.

in the year 1381, Wyclit's scholars were preaching his doctrine of
the Lord's Supper throughout England‚ and making a large number
of converts‚ both amongst rich and poor.¹ Still more important is
what it relates of the year ¹382· Its reports of Wyclif's utterances
on the sects (orders) and their founders, on the begging of these able
bodied friars (fratrum validorum) -— “that they should work after
the example of the Apostle Paul and the doctrine of St. Augustine,'’
these utterances occur, in part word for word, in some of the sermons, 2
The author describes also the consequences of Wyclif’s teaching as
follows: “In this year the friars ¹have been deprived of their alms, the
mendicants are compelled to work, they are not allowed to· preach,
they are called penny-preachers and creepers into houses (see below).
Besides this, they write scandalous pamphlets in English and write
down their errors likewise in English.''³ Finally, the Continuatio
Eulogii directly states that Wyclif's scholars studied the compiling
of sermons.⁴ In agreement with this are sundry notices in
Walsingham. .

It is of interest to observe that Walsingham’s view of the begging
orders hardly differs from that of Wyclif himself.⁵ According to
Knighton's account, the poor priests were spread over a large part
of England.6 Their chief centres were Oxford‚ Leicester and Lutter-
worth. They were naturally not allowed to proceed in their work
without interference7 and accordingly we find Wyclif complaining
that the mendicants in London and Leicester aimed at the
extermination of the faithful and poor priests.⁷ In a mandate of
