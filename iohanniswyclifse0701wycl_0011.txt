INTRODUCTION. Ι V

As the sermon infinitely‘excels every other earthly work (which
the simplest theologian can hardly doubt) so it also excels prayer
and the administration of the sacraments.¹

He compares the preacher to the king's judge. As the judge is
honoured, because of the honour due to the king, so too true priests
must be reverenced, according to the words of the Lord.

Therefore the preaching of the word of God is the work of a
‚priest which contributes most to the building up of the Church‚ for
God's word is the seed which overcomes the strongly armed‚ which
softens hardened hearts, renews men brutalized by sins and departed
far from God, and transforms them into men of godliness.

The word of the priest could not effect such a great miracle
if the spirit of life and the eternal word did not cooperate.2

In the sermon “He that heareth you, heareth me'’ 3 Wyclif proves
the high authority of the preacher: “It is not you who preach” he
cries to the preachers, “but the spirit of the Father‚ which speaks
in you; and since the works of the Holy Trinity are inseparable‚ it
is the Trinity which speaks in the priest.

Thus it will be seen how devoutly the people should attend
sermons, for to despise the preacher would mean despising Jesus
Christ in the first place, and then the Holy Trinity.

In a pamphlet against the four new sects Wyclif says: “Thus
we see that all this blessing and consecration of wax and bread, of
palmS, of candleS, of salt, of staves and pouches, of arms and of
such things is not a necessary matter of belief.

¹Nec dubium vel theologo simplici quin evangelizacio excellit quodammodo
infinite omne opus alcffimicum, eum plus sit se ipsum eruginare spiritum hominis
ad imaginem Dei factum quam purgare quodcunque opus metallicum vel facere opus
artificiale humanum, quantumcunque subtile fuerit .. .. Et per idem evangelizacio
excedit oracionem, sacramentorum ministracionem infinite . . . . evangelizaeio prodest
longe extensius et evidencius, ideo est operacio plus ecclesie preciosa
² IV, 30: O stupenda virtus divini seminis quod fortem armatum eicit, corda
quasi lapides indurata emollit et homines per peecata conversos in bestias etsie
infinitum a Deo distantes revocat et transmutans in homines efficit deiformes,
Non dubium quin tam summe mirabile non possit verbum sacerdotis perficere nisi
principaliter coesficiat calor spiritus vite et eternum verbum. ² Sermonum H, 34.
