VIII INTRODUCTION.

It is true that none, or only a few, have now-a-days the power
to perform miracles, and therefore we must choose another way, and
perceive the mystical meaning of what is said of the performing of
miracles. Thus, the preacher must heal the sick, that is to say, free
sinners from their sins; he must raise the dead, that is, convert sinners
hardened in crime3 he must cleanse the lepers, that is, call upon the
proud to practise the grace of humility. And as sins are those fetters
by which the demons are fastened to men, there can be no doubt,
that, if the preacher fulfils his duty in the first three points, the
demons too must give way. Such are the preacher’s duties: From the
results it will be seen whether the preacher preaches rightly, and this
is of greater moment for believers than the fiction of Antichrist (the
pope) that he has spiritual power over all others whilst he does
not prove by his deeds that he does spiritual good to anybody3
that he has the power to create or to change the sacraments; that
the Holy Scripture has neither authority nor validity except when
confirmed by him, rr finally that he has the power to overthrow
any dogma.1 More⁴ st· -Juently and more earnestly than anything else,
must the preacher explain the Lord's Prayer to the people, for there
is no prayer which can be more excellent, effectual and beneficial
for every Christian.‘-' “Because God’s word is not heard, and the field
of the Church is laid waste'' — exclaims Wyclif — spiritual death
reigns everywhere.

Therefore God’s word must be revived and be preached in both
languages; in Latin to the learned, and in the language of the country
to the uneducated. 3

¹ Et istud est melius fideli quam ficcio Antiehristi (cod. pal. Vindob. 3928 in
marg: papa nota) qua sine auctoritate Dei vel testimonio exparte popuIi fingit quod
habet potestatem spiritualem supra alios et non ostendit in opere quod spiritualis
beneficiencie quicquam facit, seeundo quod habet potestatem condendi et variandi
ecclesiastica sacramenta, ymmo quod =§criptura sacra non habet auctoritatem vel
efficaciam nisi de quanto is confirmaverit, ideo quemlibet articulum fidei poterit
reversare Sed veritas est quod nulla scriptura sacra propter auctorizaeionem
vel canonizaeionem eorum est magis vel minus autentica . . . . 2 Serm. Ι, 29. In
hoe evangelio debet predicator secundum sormam rudem et congruam aptare populo
sensum oracionis dominice . . . . Nulla enim oracio est ista prestancior, efficacior et
unicuique fideli utilior. :z Cf. Buddensieg, Johann Wiclif und §eine Zeit, pag. 168.
