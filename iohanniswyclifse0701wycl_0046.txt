XL INTRODUCTION.

5. The Edition.

The following text is based on the Cambridge MS. as being the
most ancient and the most perfect of the five which have been
described. The numerous errors which it contains could generally be
corrected from B and C. With regard to spelling, critical notes, and
commentary‚ I have followed the principles which guided me in
editing De Ecclesia (see page 31).

It only remains to proffer my hearty thanks to those who have
helped me in this work.

My thanks are due in the first place to Ms· F. D. Matthew who
has once more supplied the English side-notes, and to whom Ι am
indebted for numerous critical observations.

I desire also heartily to thank the respected Founder of our
Society. Ds- F. J. Furnivall, whose active help, especially in the
procuring of MSS„ has always been ready.

I am also greatly obliged to the Librarian of Trinity College
Cambridge, Dr. R. Sinker‚ and to the Librarian of the Vienna Imperial
and Royal Library, Herr Hofrath von Birk, whose liberality enabled
me to use all the MSS Ι required, in the most convenient manner.

I have also to thank the librarians of Czernowitz, Olmiitz and

Prague, for their kindness in procuring and sending me literary
assistance.
