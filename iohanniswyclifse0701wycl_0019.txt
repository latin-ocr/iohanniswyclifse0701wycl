INTRODUCTION. XIII

And as regards form, Wyclif does not after all depart very far
from the scholastic usage of his time. His sermons, if we examine
them carefully, will be found each to consist of two parm, of which
one usually (not always) treats of the meaning of the Biblical passage
on which his sermon is based. As is expounded in the Quaestio de
potestate papae — the author of which is probably Peter Dubois ¹ —-
and by Occam with some differenceS, the schoolmen suppose that
the Bible has a twofold meaning, first, the literal or historical‚ and
secondly the mystical.² This view we find, with some modifications,
in Wyclif also.3 If therefore in the first part ofa sermon the meaning
of a passage of scripture is discussed, the literal meaning is explained
first, and then the mystical. The doctors of the XIVth Century divide
the mystical meaning into the anagogical‚ the allegorical, and the
ethical. These distinctions are seldom fully kept up by Wyclif.⁴
As a rule too, as Lechler observes, the mystical interpretation consists
of nothing more than a simple setting forth of religious truths‚ and
in the moral application of the text to the audience and to present
times.

Wyclif is not contented with simply explaining the text. Following
the example set by no less a man than St. Augustine‚ he tries to
