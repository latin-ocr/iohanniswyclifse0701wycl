VT INTRODUCTION.

“It would therefore be far more commendable if Bishops would
preach and teach the catholic faith, instead of dispensing such things
as sacraments, or consecrating churches.” ¹

In Opus Evangelicum (l, 13) Wyclif enunierates the occupations
to which an educated man devotes himself: “for the theologian there
is none nobler than preaching’'.

b) What is to he preached, and who is to preach to the
people.

To the people the Gospel must be preached‚ as God commands:
the truth must be proclaimed to thern, even though they receive it
unwillingly.2 Not comedies or tragedies, not fables or droll stories
must be told to the people, but simply and solely the law of the

sive comedias, non fabulas sive ludier-ia, sed pure legem Domini, ut fecerunt
Christus et sui apostoli, quia in ipsa lege latet vita per quam vivificaretur ecclesia.
