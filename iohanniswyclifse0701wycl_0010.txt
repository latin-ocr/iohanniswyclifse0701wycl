IV INTRODUCTION.

preaching‚ is a far better and more desirable thing than deliverance
from any bodily suffering.”¹ “Amongst all the works of Christian
charity‚ says Wyclif quoting Robert Grosteste, Bishop of Lincoln,
none is nobler, better, and more to be desired than preaching.''2
A whole chapter o'f his work De Officio Pastorali (ΙΙ, 2) is devoted
to this subject.3 The value of preaching, he there says, is evident
from Christ having ordered his apostles before His ascension to
preach the gospel to all mankind, Surely the wisest of all teachers
would not have done so, were not the sermon the most laudable of
all the works of an apostle or a curate.⁴ “That preaching is the
most important work of such men, may be seen also by its success,
for Christ effected more by the proclamation of the Gospel by means
of the Apostles, than by all the miracles that He performed Himself
in Judaea.’'5 Therefore St. Augustine rightly reminds us, that the
conversion in so short a time of the immense world of heathenism,
by such simple persons as the Apostles, is a greater mii-acle of Christ's
than any other which He performed since his Incarnation. ⁶

And since, according to the Apostle Paul, it is Christ Himself who
speaks in the preacher, it follows that the praise belongs not to the
preacher, who is the medium, but to Jesus Christ Himself in the preacher.

If it be Christ Himself who creates spiritual children by means
of such sermons, a matter which is infinitely higher than any natural
generation‚ it is evident, that God's omnipotence manifests itself in
the sermon more than in any other of His works.

By means of preaching, Christ creates for Himself heirs of the
heavenly kingdom even now on earth.⁷

et expetibilius est predicacio 3 1. e. pag. 32, 33. 4 Quod nou faceret
magister summe sapiens, nisi talis predicacio fuerit magis laudanda in apostolo vel
curato. 5 Similiter ex effectu evidet: evangelizacio est opus precipuum curatoris, nam
plus proficit Christus 111 suis apostolis evangelizando gentibus quam faciendo que-
cunque miracula que 111 persona propria fecerat 111 Judea. 6 Fuit maius Christi
miraculum predicacio tanto mundo gentilium et convertendo ad fidem Christi in
tempore tam modico tautum populum personarum tam simplicium quam alia miracula
que Christus post incarnacionem secernt. Τ . . . . Iu illo opere relucet Dei potestas
plus quam 111 aliis nominaiidis; per hoc enim Christus facit sibi heredes patrie

seilicet quod cst maius miraculum hic in terris.
