XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

of Wyclifs Latin Sermons; the first Part on page 142a to 184b, the
second on 184C to 237b‚ the third on 338³ to 290C and 347³ to 352³
(here a small leaf which is not numbered is inserted), and the fourth
Part on 290d to 346³.

On the upper margin of every page is noted to which Part the
sermon below belong8‚ and what is the number of it. The initials
of the first sermon of each Part are richly decorated with colours
and gold. The initials of the other sermons with blue and red
alternately.

In the upper margins are explanations of biblical passages or
short remarks on the sermonS‚ in a contemporary hand. In the
margins to the right and left7 are marks referring to the arrangement
of the several sermonS.

Corrections are not very common. They are not in the same
hand, but in a comtemporary one. The handwriting belongs to the
end of the X1V1¹¹ or the beginning of the XVth century.

It resembles in many respects that of Codex ¹294 of the Vienna
Imperial Library, the treatises in which were in written in 1400.

The writing is firm and distinct. On page ¹57 its original
character is altered, but appears again on page 165³.

Notwithstanding this circumstance it cannot be confidentis* said,
that it is another hand which appears on page 157.

Regular, if not altogether beautiful, as the handwriting is, the
text is faulty, full of more or less serious blunders, so that it cannot
be said to have been well preserved on the whole in this MS.

Sometimes we find such gross mistakes‚ that we are led to doubt
whether the scribe understood the meaning of the text. As to the
person of the scribe7 not the slightest clue is to be found in the
Codex3 nor is there any indication of the place where the copy was
made.¹ The beauty of the embellishments would seem to favour the
conclusion that the copy was made on some great occasion, or for

a Wyclifite of high rank. 2

¹ On the last cover we find the indication: A. D. 1384 deser. in Met. v. l. 3, c. 34,
and then the verses: Esto pedana mee calige pars, sine numella
Inde pedanabo (Ρ) caligas vel sune ligabo.
Ῥ- Ex dono ornatissimi viri Thomae Nevile decani Cantuariensis et collegii Trinitatis

praefecti.
