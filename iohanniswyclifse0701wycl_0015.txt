INTRODUCTJON. IX

ln order that the Church may know and love the lise and con-
duct of Christ, it is the duty of theologians to learn and to teach
the Holy Scripture.¹

Wyclif insists frequently and strongly on the necessity of prcaching
‚the Gospel to the people in their mother tongue. Some prelatos, he

in the Holy Scripture about the poverty of the clergy,

lt is of the greatest advantage for the Churchthat believers
¹ should discern the meaning of Scripture, and this can only be done

Did not Christ and the‘apostles convert many people by preaching
in the vulgar tongue?

Why should not the modern disciples of Christ distribute the
same bread?

In both languages then the faith should of Christ be taught to
the people. 3 With great vehemence he opposes the modern Pharisees
who contend that the Gospel must not be preaclred in the language
of the people: yet to do so is but to obey 2 Lord's command:
“Go into all the world, and preach the Gospel to all mankind.'’

the popular language, is that they fear to betray how much their
own life contrasts With the Lord's life. ⁴

in style, and characterised by a downright simplicity and cordiality, in
many passages too by great depth os feeling, so that the reader, When
once he has overcome the obstacles of a somewhat difficult idiom‚
