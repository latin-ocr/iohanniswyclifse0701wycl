INTRODUCTION. XV

He quotes not only from the Bible or the ecclesiastical fathers
and doctors‚ but also from secular writers, such as Aristotle, Por-
phyrius, Averroes, Avicenna and others, and a series of arguments is
borrowed from the Decretals.

That devout laymen were edified by his sermons we have his
own testimony, in which he says (l, 13) that he has undertaken the
interpretation of the Ten Commandments in an equal number of
sermons, by the request of a pious layman. ¹

At the same 111110, most of his sermons are school or model
sermons, which he delivered either whilst still at Oxford2 and, as
is supposed, in St. Mary's Church,3 or, where they belong to a later
period, with a view to and for the use of his travelling preachers.4
Thus we find in a considerable number of sermons a reference to
studentS. “Let us therefore -— it runs in one of them —- scatter the
’ seed of benedictions, beloved brethren.''5 111 another he gives a very
clear and methodica] outline of the sermon, saying: For this reason
I have interpreted to you the Ten Commandments and to-day I will
expound the commandments of the two rables “in order that you
may learn it the better'’.⁶ Verum ut loquar pueris,⁷ he exclaims in
another passage. And the epithets which he applies to his hearers
are in harmony with this: Fraternitas vestra, Caritas vestra, fratres
carissimi (IV, 31, 45).

To these hearers, as being future preachers, the numerous directions
are addressed which he gives for preaching. These rules, he says in
another passage, must be preached perseveringly to the people, so that
the)r may comprehend whether or not they themselves or the clergy
are preserving true Christian charity. 3 This Gospel teaches, he says in
another passage, how to behave oneself in the office of preaching.⁹

quomodo dehent se hahere in officio predicandi.
