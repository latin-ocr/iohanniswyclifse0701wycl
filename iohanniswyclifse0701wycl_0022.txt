XVI INTRODUCTION.

Most frequently we find in the sermons instructions how to deal with
the matter of a sermon, whether to compose it elaborately or shortly. ¹
ln a good many passages he observes that the preacher must adapt
his discourse to the capacities of his hearers. 2 The character of these
sermons as models for preachers was clearly perceived by the early
copyists; thus one of them has inserted in the margin of the MS.
the words: Magistri et studentes, notate.

One of the sermons (Sermones mixti No. XXIV) is from beginning
to end nothing but an address on the occasion of an academie
ceremony, the conferring of the doctor’s degree. 3

The Latin sermons which belong to the Lutterworth period (and
these form a large proportion of the whole number of sermons) were
all composed by Wyclif as model-sermons for the use of the “poor
priests’'‚ or the “wandering⁷’ or “travelling’' preachers. For Wyclif by
no means confined himself to preaching his reformatory ideas to the
comparatively small number of people who composed his congregation:
God's law, in which he had found the pure truth, should rather
become the common property of all, and every Christian should

know it and observe it.

The clergy of his time, especially “the four sects''> did not fulfil
their task, and therefore he called into existence the institution of
travelling preachers or as they were called, of the “poor’' or “simple’'
priests. These were to counteract the pernicious work of the sects

¹ Π, 11: Ideo aptato sermone ad populum secundum virtutis egenciam vel sugam
vicii potest sermo pateneins quantumlibet dilatari, quadruplex interpretacio nominis
Marie virginis satis iuvat. 2 Π, 30: Sed verba exhortacionis dimissa ista materia
sunt congruencie auditorii applicanda. (Is. pag. 128: Materia autem exhortacionis
potest evangelizans secundum pertinenciam auditorii dilatare pag. 130: Et
dilatanda est materia sermonis secundum qnod expedit populo audienti . . . . pag. 133:
Et ista materia modo inenarrabilis est . . . . Et huius materia est secundum exigenciam
ruditatis populi dilatanda. Here we may pres-nme that Wyclif refers to the travelling
preachers; pag. 164: Sed quia populus communiter recipere solet eukaristiam isto
die, ideo sensns instruccioui sue pertinens est aptandus.. . . pag. 165: Aptando
autem sermones istos potest scola de virtutibus communicando auditori aptari.. . .
Ideo de humilitate atque superbia dilatari potest sentencia quantuni placet. Cf.
Ι, 30, S. 259, 260: Septem autem opera corporalis misericordie debent declarari
popnIO.... Here is also treated of the threcsold sermon: Predicacio formalis,
subiecfnlis et habitudinalis. ³ Lechler 1. c.‚ pag. 393.
