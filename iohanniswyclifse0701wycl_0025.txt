INTRODUCTION. XIX

provokes Wyclit's bitter complaint: “And as these brethren dislike
the number of begging orders to increase in one town, so they hate
that “simple priests’' asise, who preach the Gospel without desire
of gain and without the forms they use (... . sic odiunt quod
insurgant sacerdotes simplices sine questu vel forma eorum evangelium
predicantes).¹ But these monks themselves roam about, and try to
rob, wherever they can find a large number of people together, whom
they can succeed in misleading.

They scour the towns, and where abundant gifts are refused
them, they protest in vehement manner.

Such are the “creepers into houses’' of whom the Apostle speaks.”

From this description it may be gathered what part the “poor
priests'’ were intended to play. But laymen too, as well as priests
were called to the office of preaching. It seems certain, Wyclif says,
that one single unlearned man may, by the grace of God, effect more
for the edification of Christ’s church than many who have graduated
in‘ schools or colleges for such a one scatters more modestly and
abundantly the seed of Christ’s law.² And in a second passage he
says plainly, that in order to hold an office in the church, the divine
calling and authorization is absolutely sufficient.

There is an ordination by God Himself, even without the episcopal
laying on of hands. 3

Wyclif’s sermons were intended for these travelling preachers;
and this was the case also with another series of his writings.4 That
they fully answered their purpose, and that the seed sown by their
means bore abundant fruit, we have manifold testimony from con-
temporary writers. The continuatio Eulogii Historiarum relates that

Nec sufficiunt pauperes et pauci fideles sacerdotes resistere.. . . ² ibid. pag. 54:
Et quantum ad fructum, certum videtur quod unus ydiota mediante Dei gracia plus
proficit ad edificandum Christi eeclesiam quani multi graduati in scolis sive collegiis,
quia seminat humilius et copiosius legem Christi tarn opere quam sermone. . ..
3 Lechler 1. c., pag. 106: Videtur ergo quod ad esse talis ministerii ecclesie requiritur
auctoritas acceptacionis divine et per consequens potestas atque noticia data a Deo
ad tale ministerium peragendum, quibus habitis, licet episcopus secundum tradiciones
suas non imposuit illi manus, Deus per se instituit. Cf. Eul. Hist. Contin. ad annum
