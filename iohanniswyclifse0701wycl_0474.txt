4 ξ 4, Need quore Money and Editors.

4. The Society wants more money and more Editors.
Those few Members who have complaind of the small issues
of the Society, forget that nearly half their Subscriptions has
had to be spent in copying (including Editors’ journeys to
examine or collate MSS). The figures are as follows :—

Copying, etc. .....1882-3 2115 18· (ci Printing and Binding, 1883 {2 lg. a}

Reasonable folk will see at once that with this great outlay on
copying—an outlay without which the Society could not have
moved a step—large issues of books have been impossible.
Moreover‚ Members must remember that over {8150 worth
of work done for them has been paid, not by them, but by the
Bishops' Fund (AE100)‚ and by the other donations to the Society
which have amounted to „855 133. The Committee cannot make
bricks without straw. The Society's issues depend solely 011
1116 amount its Members subscribe3 and if any Member com-
plains of the smallness of the 1881168, 116 should feel bound in
conscience to accompany his complaint with a 3850 note in
order that his grievance may be remedied, The Society has
a big job 111 hand, the payment of England’s debt to its great
early Reformer's memory, the printing of all the Latin
works he has left, in which the record and development of
his ideas are to be traced. Many years of strenuous effort
are needed for this task‚ both on the part of Members 111
general and the Society's Editors in particular. Much copying
of MSS. has still to be done. New Editors for some of
the Treatises already copied, and for those still untoucht, are
wanted. The preparation of a Wyclif MS. for press is no
easy matter, as Dr. Poole explaind in the Report for 1884,
and often takes years of the scanty leisure which an Editor
can spare from the other engrossing work of his life. Mean-
time the duty of subscribing Members 18 clear: to provide
the money wanted for copying and printing; to pay their
own Subscriptions promptly, and canvass all their friends
and acquaintances for more.

Society's Editors‚ Copiers‚ and Helpers, and specially 10
