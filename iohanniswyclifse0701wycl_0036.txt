XXX INTRODUCTION.

orders than against France.¹ ln the fourth sermon Wyclif says, the
monks have, at the “earthquake council'’‚ condemned as heretical the
doctrine that only the predestinate are members of holy Mother
Church.2 The so-called “earthquake council'’‚ mentioned several
times in Wyclif’s sermons, was held in May 1382. That Wyclif speaks
of it as something passed, corroborates the foregoing remarks on the
date. From the 23⁸³ sermon onwardS, the character of the sermons
is greatly altered: so much so that one is inclined to assign the
composition of these sermons to an earlier period. But if this
supposition be correct, Wyclif must have made some alterations in
them during the years 1383 and 1384. Some of the dates which
Wyclif gives in these sermons can only then have been inserted.

In the 26111 sermon vve find the remark, that it was to be
delivered on St. Nicholas’ day,3 and in another sermon of the same
part that it was to be given on St. Augustine's day.⁴ Now these
sermons (or at least a great part of thern) are Sunday sermonS‚ as
is evidenced by various allusions as well as by direct statements:5
Therefore these two sermons may have been held the same year
(i. e. in an ecclesiastical year beginning with Advent) in which the
61¹¹ of December and the 28⁸¹ of August fell on SundayS.

This is the year 1383s4.

There cannot therefore be any doubt that a great number of
the sermons of the fourth part were composed in the years 1383s4,
and that the remainder were finally revised during these yearS.

Sermon No. 63 of the fourth part, however, leads us back to the
time of the Schism.

The third part of the Sermones was not composed much earlier.
