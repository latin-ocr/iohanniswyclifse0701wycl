INTR ODUtTTtON. XXI

Archbishop Courtenay's, issued at the end of May 1382, and in the
Archbishop's license to the Carmelite Peter Stokes at Oxford, complaint
is made of certain travelling preacher5‚ who under the pretence of
great sanctity (sub magne sanctitatis velamine), usurp the office of
preaching, and defend false, erroneOUS, and heretical doctrines and

dogmas, in churches, in streets and in other places.
It is now most severely prohibited that these doctrines, twenty-

four of which are expressly named, should henceforth be tolerated.¹

This, and similar prohibitions of the secular authorities‚2 were .
attended with but little success. The conviction of the necessity of
an internal reformation of the church was implanted by Wyclif’s

disciples in the minds of all classes.

Their success may very probably have been mainly due to their
manner of life, which contrasted so strongly with that of the begging
friars and the other clergy3 and if the majority of the poor preachers
answered to the life-like description which Chaucer gives in his
Canterbury tales of the good country ckrgyman, and which many
take to be a portrait of Wyclif3 himself, the great success of the
country preachers may be easily explained.

But riche he was of holy thought and werlt'.
He was also a lcrned man, a clerk.
