XXII INTRODUCTION.

It required all the strength of the violent political and ecclesiastica]
reaction which followed, to put a stop to the work of the poor
priests in England. As a result of this reaction‚ Wyclif’s sermons
too fell into oblivion in that country. On the other hand, they exercised
vast influence on great numbers of the educated in Bohemia and
Moravia during many following decades.

2. Wyolif’s sermons and their adaptatmn by Hus.

Wyclif’s sermons are among those writings of his, which enjoyed
especial popularity in Bohemia. In the catalogues of Wyclif's works
which were circulated in Bohemia, and which date from the ¹4⁸¹ century
the following sermons are enumerated:

1. Sermones de tempore per circulum anni supra Evangelia.l

2. Quadraginta Sermones, compositi dum stetit in scolis.‘-’

3. Sermones viginti compositi in fine vite sue.3

4. Epistolarum Sermones de tempore per circulum anni}

Among the books which fell victims in the celebrated autodafe
on June 16⁸¹ 1410, in the court, yard of the archiepiscopal palace at
Prague, was Wyclif’s: ‘Super evangelia Sermones per circulum anni',⁵
and in that witty discourse in which on July 29111 ¹410 Simon of
Tissnow defended W'yclif's treatise ‘De probacionibus proposicionum’
wherein he addresses the little book in his caustic manner, “Alas
probably thou hast scourged the insatiable and unfathomable greediness
of the priests‚‘' it runs:

“Not I have committed this but the “sermones”‚ which indeed
are now condemned with me.'' ‘5

It is easy to see how these sermons came to enjoy such great
repute; and we shall not be surprised to find Hus consulting them
in the compilation of his own sermons
